# Server-Side-API-Weather-Dashboard
 
Description: 

The motivation for building this application was the desire to create an application that uses jQuery and the OpenWeather third-party API in order to dynamically update HTML and CSS. This application also uses the Web Storage API. The reason for building this specific project was the need for an application that displays the weather outlook for a selected city. The OpenWeather API was used for retrieving the current day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. It was also used to display the temperature and humidity for the following 5 days.
